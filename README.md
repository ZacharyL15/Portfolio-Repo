# 📊 Data Science Portfolio – Zachary LaRochelle

Welcome! This repository contains a curated collection of my data science projects, showcasing real-world applications of machine learning, data analysis, and engineering workflows. These projects reflect skills I've developed through academic work, internships, and independent exploration.

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:
- A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the full workflow
- A README detailing the project's background, tools used, and key insights
- Visualizations, model results, and commentary on findings

## 🔍 Projects

### 1. [🏥 Predictive Modeling in Healthcare Outcomes](./healthcare-prediction-project/)
> Built regression and classification models using real-world clinical datasets to predict patient survival and disease presence. Focused on interpretability, feature scaling, and model evaluation across two healthcare prediction tasks.

**Skills:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, linear/logistic regression, cross-validation, evaluation metrics, healthcare data analysis

### 2. [📊 Internship Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](./internship-eda-project/)
> Performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis on a proprietary dataset during a data science internship, uncovering key insights, assessing data quality, and guiding feature engineering for downstream modeling.

**Skills:** Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, data visualization, missing data analysis, correlation analysis

### 3. [🔄 Refresh Update Failure Modeling](./refresh-update-failure-modeling/)
> Built classification models including XGBoost and hyperparameter tuning to predict data pipeline refresh failures. Used SHAP for interpretability and KQL for data querying.

**Skills:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, hyperparameter tuning, KQL, exploratory data analysis
