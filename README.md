# ðŸ“Š Data Science Portfolio â€“ Zachary LaRochelle

Welcome! This repository contains a curated collection of my data science projects, showcasing real-world applications of machine learning, data analysis, and engineering workflows. These projects reflect skills I've developed through academic work, internships, and independent exploration.

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:
- A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the full workflow
- A README detailing the project's background, tools used, and key insights
- Visualizations, model results, and commentary on findings
