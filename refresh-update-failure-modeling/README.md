# 🔄 Refresh Update Failure Modeling

This project focuses on building classification models to predict refresh update failures in a data pipeline environment. The goal was to identify failure patterns early to improve monitoring and reduce downtime.

## 📈 Project Overview

- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand failure causes and feature distributions.
- Developed classification models including baseline classifiers and XGBoost.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability and feature importance analysis.
