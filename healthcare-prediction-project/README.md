# 🏥 Predictive Modeling in Healthcare Outcomes

This project applies machine learning techniques to two real-world healthcare datasets to predict patient outcomes through both regression and classification tasks.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

Using two distinct datasets, this project explores:
- **Survival prediction** for patients with heart failure (regression task)
- **Disease classification** for cervical cancer risk (classification task)

The work includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using standard performance metrics. Emphasis was placed on model interpretability, reproducibility, and effective preprocessing.
